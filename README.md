# Problems to document later

- sentinel ref issue and how to do it properly (briefly dive into react's rendering cycle)
- pagination and using queryFn for both fetches
- use infiinite query and how it maintains references under the hood

# todos for stock detail page

- skeleton for loading
- Make sure to break it down into smaller components so we can show different skeletons for different parts where it actually makes sense
- prefetching when hovering tab
- make charts look nicer and less confusing, cut off, etc.
- we need to look into how we use timeframe state, i would propose using react query as a global state management thingy for this so that all components can listen to it in real time
